161.	The best times to buy a new car are at the end of the month, the end of the quarter and the end of the year. Dealers and their salespeople are rewarded for meeting sales goals during those time periods, so the sale of a few more vehicles could result in their getting a huge bonus that is based on all the vehicles they sold before the end of that time period. In these situations, dealers and salespeople are so motivated to close a sale that they will let some new cars go with little-or-no profit in the deal.
162.	No, there are no laws giving you a "three day right to cancel" or any kind of cooling-off period that would permit you to return a car that you bought. However, if the dealer puts that language in your contract (most dealers won't), then it might be possible. Just remember: if something you want is not in writing, you're probably not going to get it.
163.	The dealer invoice price is NOT the real dealer cost on a new car or truck. Dealers get all kinds of cash incentives, rewards and bonuses after new vehicles are sold, which allows them to make huge profits when they sell at the invoice price.
164.	In most cases, leasing is NOT cheaper than buying. If you typically keep new cars longer than three years, then buying is going to be cheaper in the long run.
165.	A good lease deal is no money down, lease term 36 months or less, and a $200 monthly payment - or as close to this as you can get. 
166.	Our inventory is primarily 1-Owner Carfax Certified cars and truck. Most of our vehicles are Factory Certification Eligible.
167.	Yes, simply fill out our locater request and we will locate a vehicle that meets your requirements.
168.	Yes we welcome any independent inspection to be performed on all of our vehicles.
169.	We have access to all original equipment part as well as all aftermarket and high performance. Feel free to contact us if you have any specific questions or requests.
170.	We recommend you have your brakes inspected approximately every 2nd oil change. This is the best way to ensure top safety and performance, and avoid long-term damage.
171.	If you feel that something’s not right with your vehicle, the best thing you can do is write down the symptoms, come in and see us, and give us the best explanation that you can.
172.	When driving in the winter, be sure to familiarize yourself with potential conditions, such as hydroplaning or snow, keep emergency numbers available at all times.
173.	As an environmentally-friendly automotive shop, Victoria Transmission and Auto Care is proud to offer tips and tricks to our valued customers, to help you be a more ‘green’ driver.
174.	Very! Following your vehicle's routine maintenance schedule is the most effective thing you can do to preserve your vehicle's resale value and prolong its working life.
175.	One of the most obvious reasons to buy used is the cost involved – used cars are, on average, 50% cheaper than new cars. Finance options will also be much more convenient, with shorter terms and lower payments.
176.	At the moment, we do not offer leasing options for used cars, but you can opt for our other great solutions, such as a Personal Contract Plan or Hire Purchase.
177.	Oftentimes it is not possible to receive a detailed history of your car – this is not the case at Thame Cars. Each one of our used cars comes with thorough information, is under 25,000 miles, visually looked after and screened through a 100-point safety check before being sold, so you can be sure that our cars are as reliable as they come.
178.	Used cars are priced according to their specifications, age and condition. At Thames, all our cars enjoy low prices and great quality – each one is carefully inspected and under 25,000 miles.
179.	Used cars are taxed according to where you buy them from and when they were registered. Buying a car with a registration certificate (V5C) from a dealer ensures that switching to a used car will be hassle-free and that you get all the help you need with the process.
180.	It is estimated that the use of air conditioning in a typical car reduces fuel economy by one to two miles per gallon. For larger cars, or when traveling in extreme heat, air conditioning cuts fuel economy up to four miles per gallon.
181.	Definitely. When tires are cold, add five pounds to the pressures recommended by your car's manufacturer. But don't overload the car because excessive loads and sharp impacts can cause tire cord breaks and create damaging heat buildup because of abnormal sidewall flexing.
182.	A car engine shouldn't be left idling unnecessarily for more than a minute. It takes less fuel to start a car than it takes to let it idle while waiting, say, for a long freight train to pass.
183.	An engine shouldn't idle for more than 15 to 30 seconds in any season, especially if it's fuel-injected.
184.	The old models were more colorful and simpler to fix. But they were fuel-guzzling, overweight polluters that didn't stay in tune as long as modern cars. Also, while most 1950s cars rarely exceeded 100,000 miles without lots of maintenance and gentle driving, even low-priced 1990s autos are routinely driven far more than 100,000 miles with minimal maintenance. They're also safer, with items such as air bags, advanced safety belt systems, anti-lock brakes and "crush" zones that let the car--not its occupants--absorb the impact in collisions. Being lighter and more efficient, they're faster with a V-6 than most of the old V-8s.
185.	Buy gasoline at busy stations to ensure you don't get a "bad load" that has been sitting too long in a tank. Also, don't buy gas at a station at the same time you see a delivery truck filling an underground tank--and stirring up impurities in the fuel in that tank.
186.	While window shopping is a good way to get started on your car buying journey, the only way to get the best feel for a vehicle is to get behind the wheel for a test drive.
187.	Regular maintenance helps to keep any vehicle running at optimum levels.
188.	Oil changes should be done every three months or every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, whichever comes first.
189.	Oil changes are necessary to keep your vehicle running in good condition, as oil provides lubrication for your engine and helps maintain cleanliness.
190.	Your vehicle should be able to travel in a straight line without corrective action from you when the steering wheel is in the proper position. If it can't, your automobile may be out of alignment.
191.	This is a vehicle history report based on the VIN number of the vehicle. A CarFax report typically provides information like how many owners the car has had and if it has been in an accident.
192.	This is the amount that the dealership will credit you towards a new purchase based on the value of the vehicle that you have traded in.
193.	If you don't mind listing the vehicle, marketing it, scheduling potential buyers, worrying about damage done during a test drive and other "costs," then you might choose to sell it yourself.
194.	You will always find an extensive inventory of new Dodge cars and RAM trucks at competitive prices at our Dodge dealership, no matter the time of year. 
195.	If you want your car to run for years, be sure to get it regular maintenance. When you schedule regular maintenance at our Ford service center, you will feel confident in the health of your vehicle.
196.	We buy from sellers like Mercedes-Benz Credit, BMW Financial, and etc....If you've ever leased or purchased a new car from a Mercedes-Benz Dealer, then you probably were financed through either your own credit union or Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp.
197.	Leasing a new Toyota sedan or a new luxury SUV has several advantages. If you like the idea of driving a new car every few years, don't drive a lot of miles per year (12,000 or less), don't relish the idea of trading in or selling a vehicle after your purchase it, then leasing at our car dealership in Indianapolis, IN makes a lot of sense.
198.	Not at all. We're living in a pre-owned vehicle "golden age", where the quality and reliability possessed by pre-owned cars, and especially certified pre-owned cars, is at an all-time high. For example, every certified used car for sale is exhaustively inspected, refurbished into "like new" condition, and comes with an exceptional warranty, maintenance discounts, and much more.
199.	Anyone who is not currently affiliated with a car dealership, or has not worked for any car dealership in the past 5 years can write a review provided he/she has had firsthand experience with the dealership. 
200.	Your check engine light could be on for a multitude of reasons from the gas cap not being sealed properly to sensors or an even bigger issue.

151. Serverless computing, also known as function as a service (FaaS), is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping of a function's container platform as a service (PaaS) as necessary to serve requests, and requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour.��
152. The AWS Serverless Application Repository offers a growing collection of serverless applications published by AWS and other AWS partners and developers. The Serverless Application Repository makes it easy to deploy applications for common use cases like web and mobile back-ends, stream processing, machine learning, and more, so you can quickly get started with the AWS Serverless platform.��
153. AWS Lambda is an Amazon serverless computing system that runs code and automatically manages your underlying compute resources. It lets you automatically run code in response to many types of events, such as HTTP requests from Amazon API gateway, table updates in Amazon DynamoDB, and state transitions. It also enables you to extend to other AWS services with custom logic, and even create your own back-end services.��
154. The SAM Command Line Interface (CLI) lets you locally build, test, and debug serverless applications defined by AWS SAM templates. SAM CLI provides a Lambda-like execution environment locally and helps you catch issues upfront.��
155. You can use AWS SAM to build serverless applications that use�any runtime supported by AWS Lambda. You can also use SAM CLI to locally debug Lambda functions written in Node.js, Java, Python, and Go.�
156. There is no additional charge to use AWS SAM. You pay for the AWS resources created using SAM in the same manner as if you created them manually. You only pay for what you use, as you use it. There are no minimum fees and no required upfront commitments.�
157. You can install AWS SAM CLI on Linux, Mac, or Windows using pip. To get started,�visit our installation documentation.��
158.  AWS SAM and the SAM CLI are open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. You can contribute new features and enhancements to�AWS SAM on GitHub�or the�AWS SAM CLI on GitHub.�
159. Serverless applications are deployed as AWS CloudFormation stacks, which make it easy for you to manage an application as a single unit. Each resource is tagged with the application�s uniquely identifiable Amazon Resource Name (ARN), which helps you locate the resources using the AWS Tag Editor console. You can also use existing AWS and third-party tools to manage each resource separately.�
160. If you would like to charge a fee for the use of a serverless application, you can integrate AWS Lambda behind Amazon API Gateway, and then sell the API as a SaaS product through the AWS Marketplace. To learn more, review the steps to list on AWS Marketplace and how to monetize your API using API Gateway.�
161.  Building serverless applications means that your developers can focus on their core product instead of worrying about managing and operating servers or runtimes, either in the cloud or on-premises. This reduced overhead lets developers reclaim time and energy that can be spent on developing great products which scale and that are reliable.�
162.  Support is available in markets where Microsoft Azure is offered. Some specific services may not be covered in all regions immediately after General Availability (GA).�
163. Break-fix issues are technical problems you experience while using Azure services. "Break-fix" is an industry term that refers to �work involved in supporting a technology when it fails in the normal course of its function, which requires intervention by a support organization to be restored to working order."�

Yes! It works great with an Apple TV (I use it on my 4th gen). This is excellent for watching movies, esp. and for playing your music library and/or music on your computer if iTunes sharing is turned on. Plays Pandora if you have that app as well- all of your audio-out needs. It doesn't stay active with the Apple TV if you use it for other things, but it is really easy to access your audio settings and re-select it with needed, similar to an iPhone or iPad. It, unfortunately, doesn't work as a general TV speaker- only ATV. I don't think you can control anything besides volume by voice through the HomePod-conneccted ATV. But the Siri remote is just as easy, really.
Yes you are able to independently play Apple Music (of the same subscription) on both your iPhone and HomePod concurrently.
Hi. Yes, I've just done exactly that. Australia use compatible plugs and voltage. Only had it a couple of days, but the HomePod seems to be working fine for me here in NZ.
not only are you unable to open spotify, you are unable to open other "third party" apps such as my local KRCC public radio app and or distribute the stream from that app, through my apple based home stereo system using apple express devices
I have just set this up - via Apple TV 4th generation - works great as I purchased 2 home pods from the US and brought them up to Canada earlier. Simply pair the home pods and on Apple TV select the paired home pods in the Video out. 
I purchased one in America and use it in Japan, since I am an expat. Works fine. Doesn’t have all the features as it would in America and has trouble with artist names and song names that are Japanese. But if you speak English well you should have no problem.
At launch, the only music app that will have full functionality (Hey Siri, play my pop playlist. Hey Siri, add this song to my favorites.) will be Apple Music. Any other music service can be played through airplay to HomePod, but you can only skip, search and edit playlists on the device, not through HomePod.
HomePod natively only supports Apple Music as noted on the HomePod website.
No, you cannot pair AirPods with the HomePod as bluetooth connectivity is not supported with the HomePod. 
You cannot set HomePod as your default speaker for your Mac as it is not an audio device, but an AirPlay device. AirPlay is automatically turned off when you shut your Mac down.
Yes, no problem
not as of yet
Yes. The iPhone 5SE is supported.
You can currently use the HomePod for phone calls that you initiate on your iPhone and then use HomePod as a speakerphone. You can’t initiate the call on the HomePod.
hue yes
HomeKit Enabled Devices.
I don't think so. 
iBooks, audiobooks, homepod
Power cord must be plugged into an outlet. There is no rechargeable battery.
You will have to subscribe to Apple Music for unlimited music streaming on HomePod.
Not directly at the moment.
Yes, you can create a stereo in one room by pairing them.

The Apple HomePod combines a powerful, intelligent speaker system with the Siri personal assistant and HomeKit compatibility.
HomePod is a wireless “smart” speaker. Once you’ve set it up using your iPhone or iPad, you can control HomePod using your voice.
You can interact with the touchpad to do things when you don’t want to use your voice. Tap and hold to directly invoke Siri. Tap on the Plus or Minus button to change the volume. Double tap to go the next song and triple tap to go to the previous track.
Siri right now can’t detect multiple voices.

1. Alexa allows you to ask questions and make requests using just your voice. For instance, you can ask Alexa a question, such as "What is the weather today in New York?", or tell Alexa to do something, like "Add batteries to my shopping list," or "Play jazz." When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to Amazon's cloud so we can process and respond to your request. You access Alexa differently based on the type of device you are using. For "hands free" devices, like the Amazon Echo, you access Alexa by saying the wake word (Alexa, Echo, Amazon, or Computer). For other devices, like certain Fire tablets, you access Alexa by pressing a button.
2. When you speak to Alexa, a recording of what you asked Alexa is sent to Amazon�s cloud where we process your request and other information to respond to you. For example, when you ask �Alexa, play top hits on Amazon Music� we use the recording of your request and information from Amazon Music to play top hits.
3. No. Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (Alexa, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button).
4. Yes. You can review voice recordings associated with your account and delete those voice recordings one by one or all at once by visiting Privacy in Settings in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy . You can also review those voice recordings by visiting History in Settings in the Alexa app and delete those voice recordings all at once for each of your Alexa-enabled products by visiting Manage Your Content and Devices. Deleting voice recordings may degrade your Alexa experience. If you delete voice recordings, we will also remove Home Screen Cards in the Alexa app related to those voice recordings. However, removing a Home Screen Card from your Alexa app does not delete voice recordings. If you have changed your default marketplace while using an Alexa-enabled product, you will need to perform this step for each marketplace to delete all voice recordings associated with your account. Note that deleting your voice recordings does not remove your Alexa messages. For more information on removing messages, refer to the FAQ "How do I remove messages?"
5. Alexa uses your voice recordings and other information, including from third-party services, to answer your questions, fulfil your requests, and improve your experience and our services. We associate your requests with your Amazon account to allow you to review your voice recordings, access other Amazon services (e.g., so you can ask Alexa to read your Kindle books and play audiobooks from Audible), and to provide you with a more personalized experience. For example, keeping track of the songs you have listened to helps Alexa choose what songs to play when you say, �Alexa, play music.� At times, Alexa may make recommendations to you based on your requests. For example, Alexa may recommend Alexa skills you might like based on the Alexa skills you use.
6. Alexa is designed to get smarter every day. The more you use Alexa, the more the service adapts to your speech patterns, vocabulary, and personal preferences. For example, we use your requests to Alexa to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems. The more data we use to train these systems, the better Alexa works, and training Alexa with voice recordings from a diverse range of customers helps ensure Alexa works well for everyone. You can also help us improve our voice services by providing feedback within History in the Alexa app.
7. Skills are voice-driven Alexa capabilities. You can view and enable skills in your Alexa app and enable certain skills by voice. You can use a skill by saying a specific phrase, called the invocation name. When you use a skill, we may exchange related information with the developer of that skill, such as your answers when you play a trivia skill, your ZIP code when you ask for the weather, or the content of your requests. If you make a request to Alexa without using a skill invocation name, we may send the content of your request to several skills, and enable and launch the skill we think is best able to respond to your request. The Skills portion of your Alexa app contains more information about skills, such as applicable policies or terms of use provided by skill developers.
8. Prime members can ask Alexa to order or reorder eligible products available for sale through the Amazon website. You can also subscribe to eligible services using Alexa, purchase songs or albums from our Digital Music Store, or purchase products and services through Alexa skills using your default payment and shipping settings. You can require a speakable confirmation code, turn purchasing off, and see product and order details in your Alexa app or at https://alexa.amazon.comfor those orders. Just like orders placed through the Amazon website, orders placed through Alexa are subject to Amazon's Conditions of Use and Privacy Notice in the case of a subscription for a service, the terms for the applicable service. Voice purchasing from Amazon is turned off for FreeTime on Alexa. Some Alexa skills allow you to purchase non-digital products or services from the developer of the skill (for instance, order food through a restaurant's skill) via Amazon Pay using your default payment and shipping settings. You can view your Amazon Pay order history and find additional information for those purchases on the Amazon Pay website. Some other Alexa skills allow you to purchase products and services from the developer of the skill using a payment method you provide directly to the developer. Your voice purchasing settings may not apply to those purchases.
9. Yes, Alexa has voice purchasing settings. Open Settings > Voice Purchasing in your Alexa app to turn off voice purchasing from Amazon. You can also require an optional confirmation code that Alexa will ask you to say out loud when you want to place an order from Amazon.
10. For information on return policies applicable to non-digital products purchased on Amazon using Alexa, see About Our Returns Policies. Amazon's return policies do not apply to purchases of non-digital products or services made through third-party Alexa skills (for instance, a food order placed through a restaurant's skill). Instead, the returns policy of the applicable skill developer applies. However, the Amazon Pay A-to-z Guarantee covers qualified purchases of physical products made through third-party Alexa skills using Amazon Pay. Purchases of digital content are final. However, if you accidentally purchase digital content or a subscription to a non-Amazon service through Alexa, that purchase is eligible for return and refund if we receive your request within 7 days of the date of purchase. To request a refund, please contact customer service. You may cancel the auto-renewal of a subscription to a non-Amazon service by visiting the detail page for the applicable Alexa skill in your Alexa app and adjusting your subscription settings; you will not receive a refund of any fees already paid. For subscriptions to Amazon services, see the terms of use for the applicable subscription for information on refund eligibility and cancellation terms.
11. Alexa also allows you to donate to eligible charities by voice. When you make a donation, Amazon Pay will process the donation using your default Amazon payment settings and will share your name, address, and email with the charity. Your voice purchasing settings apply to donations. If you accidentally make a donation through Alexa or donate to the wrong charity, please contact customer service. You can see details of your donation in your Alexa app or at https://alexa.amazon.com.
12. Kid skills are skills that have been identified by the developer as directed to children under age 13. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we require permission from a parent before kid skills can be used. You'll be asked to give permission the first time you attempt to use a kid skill. After you've given permission, you will receive a confirmation e-mail. You can review or change permissions by visiting the Manage Parental Consent page on Amazon.com or by contacting Customer Service ( https://www.amazon.com/contact-us). To learn more, please visit our Children's Privacy Disclosure.
13. Alexa enables you to control and check the status of a variety of smart home devices, such as lights, switches, cameras and thermostats. See compatible smart home devices . You can connect compatible smart home devices to Alexa using Alexa smart home skills. You can also directly connect certain smart home devices to Echo devices with a built-in smart home hub like Echo Plus. We may automatically update the firmware for certain devices on behalf of the applicable manufacturer. We may receive information about third-party smart home devices you connect to Alexa, such as device type, name, features, and status and usage history. You can delete Alexa�s status and usage history for third-party smart home devices through the Manage Smart Home Device History tab of the Privacy Settings in the Alexa app or https://www.amazon.com/alexaprivacy . Deleting this history may degrade your Alexa experience and certain features, such as Hunches. This will not delete other information about your smart home devices, such as device type or name.
14. Alexa can automatically recognize the voices of users in your household over time to improve personalization of certain Alexa features. You can also create a voice profile, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience. When Alexa recognizes your voice automatically, or when you create a voice profile, Alexa uses recordings of your voice to create an acoustic model of your voice characteristics. Alexa stores these acoustic models in the cloud. If a user stops using Alexa and their voice is not recognized for three years, we will automatically delete the acoustic model for their voice. You can turn off automatic voice recognition or delete any voice profile you've created in the Alexa app. Automatic voice recognition is not available in certain locations.
15. This free feature brings the simplicity of Echo's hands-free experience, the benefit of Echo's microphone array, plus the high-quality sound of the Echo speaker, to calling and messaging. Now you can quickly call and send/receive voice messages for your family and friends via Alexa�all just by using your voice. Using your supported Echo device, simply say "Alexa, call Grandma" or "Alexa, send a message to Julie".
16. You can send and receive Alexa messages (and place and receive Alexa calls) between a supported Echo device and the Alexa App on supported mobile phones and tablets. Alexa Calling and Messaging may also be available on some third party Alexa-enabled products. Features may vary by device.
17. You can use supported Echo devices and the Alexa App to send voice and text messages to another Alexa calling and messaging user(e.g., on Echo, "Alexa, send a message to Mum" or, on the Alexa App, tapping on the message icon on Mum's contact card). Messages are processed in the Cloud to convert voice messages to text, and vice versa. When you receive a message on a supported Echo device, you will hear an audio tone and see a visual notification. You will be able to retrieve the message on your supported Echo devices by saying "Alexa, play my messages". When you receive a message, you also will receive a notification on your mobile phone or tablet, and you will be able to view and play the message in the Alexa App. Alexa messaging does not support sending or receiving text messages to or from phone numbers.
18. You can use supported Echo devices and the Alexa App to call another Alexa Calling and Messaging user (e.g., on Echo, "Alexa, call Mum" or, on the Alexa App, tapping on the calling icon on Mum's contact card). When you receive Alexa calls on your supported Echo devices, Alexa will tell you that you have an incoming call and identify the caller. You also will see a rotating green light indicator on Echo devices without a screen, and an incoming call screen on Echo devices with a screen. You can say "Alexa, answer" to pick up the call. Either person can end the call by saying "Alexa, hang up". When you receive a call, you also will receive a notification on your mobile phone or tablet and will see an incoming call screen in the Alexa App that lets you answer the call. Alexa calling does not support calling phone numbers or receiving calls from phone numbers. For information on placing calls using Echo Connect, see the below FAQ "How does calling on Echo Connect work?"
19. No, you can't reach emergency services, such as 999 or 112, through Alexa calling and messaging. You should ensure that you can contact your relevant emergency services providers through a mobile, landline telephone, or other service. For information on calling emergency services using Echo Connect, see the below FAQ "Can I call emergency services with Echo Connect?"
20. When you register for Alexa calling and messaging on your Alexa App, you will be asked to import your contacts, which will then appear as contacts in your Alexa App. When you open the Alexa App, your contacts are auto-updated from your tablet or mobile phone. You can also add contacts at alexa.amazon.co.uk
21. First you must register for Alexa Calling and Messaging. Once you are registered, if another Alexa Calling and Messaging user has your contact details, they can reach you via Alexa.
22. If you call or message another Alexa Calling and Messaging user (e.g. "Jane Smith"), the call or message will go to all supported Echo devices associated with that contact, as well as that contact's Alexa App.
23. Do Not Disturb puts your Echo device on silent, meaning you will not receive calls or messages via Alexa. Simply say "Alexa, turn on do not disturb" or you can turn it on in Settings in the Alexa App. When you're ready to receive calls and messages again, just say "Alexa, turn off do not disturb".
24. On the iOS version of the Alexa App, swipe a conversation to the left and click "Remove". On the Android version of the Alexa App, long-press on a conversation to select it, then tap the trash icon in the top navigation bar. Note that removing a conversation from your conversation list does not remove it from your contact's conversation list. It is not possible for you to remove sent or received messages from a contact's conversation list.
25. You can call Customer Service, and we will help you de-register from Alexa Calling and Messaging.
26. The optional Drop In feature will let you easily connect with your closest friends and family on supported Echo devices. To give Drop In permission to yourself (and your household) or a contact (and that contact�s household), select the applicable contact card and turn on Drop In. In addition, you can give Drop In permission to yourself (and your household) by simply saying �Alexa, Drop In on Home�. To turn off Drop In for your household, you can simply say �Alexa, disable Drop In�. Alternatively, you can turn on Do Not Disturb on one, or all, Echo devices by saying "Alexa, turn on Do Not Disturb". You also may disable Drop In for a specific device via the device settings in the Alexa App.
27. When someone drops in on your supported Echo device, you will hear an audio tone and see a visual indicator that someone is dropping in on you. The contact on the other side of the Drop In will automatically hear audio through your device. You may end the Drop In by saying "Alexa, hang up". On Echo devices without a screen, you will see a green in-call light indicator showing that a Drop In is in progress. If a contact with the Alexa App or an Echo device with a screen drops in on your Echo device with a screen, they will see a frosted glass view from your device's camera. The frosted glass view will automatically transition to clear video over a short period of time. You will see the contact's video (and a picture-in-picture view of your own video) when the Drop In is in progress. You can end a Drop In by tapping the end icon on the screen, or you can disable the camera while continuing an audio conversation by saying "Alexa, video off" or tapping the video off icon on the screen.
28. If household members or contacts have been granted Drop In permission, they will see a recently active indicator on their Echo Show, Echo Spot or Alexa App displaying whether someone is nearby your supported Echo devices. Interactions with Alexa, and motion sensors on Echo Show, will be used to determine whether your device has been recently active.
29. If you have granted your household members Drop In permission, you can disable it by saying �Alexa, disable Drop In� or turning off Drop In on your own contact card. If you have granted any other contacts Drop In permission, you can disable that on their contact cards. You also may disable Drop In for a specific device via the device settings in the Alexa App.
30. The Announcements feature lets you easily make announcements to other supported Echo devices within your household, like a one-way intercom. Simply say, �Alexa, announce that dinner�s ready� and �Dinner�s ready� will then be announced in your voice to all supported Echo devices in your household. You can block Announcements on one, or all, Echo devices by turning on Do Not Disturb � simply say "Alexa, turn on Do Not Disturb". Unlike Drop In, Announcements are one-way only. To respond to an Announcement, you can make a new Announcement or start a Drop In as a two-way intercom.
31. Yes, you can link select third-party communications services with Alexa Calling and Messaging. Simply go to �Communications� within Settings in the Alexa App. Amazon may import and save your contacts from your third-party communications service in the Cloud to help you connect with your friends and family. Some features may not be available via Alexa, and charges from the third-party communications service may apply for use of some features. You should check any terms applicable to the third-party communications service (including whether emergency services are available) prior to linking your account with Alexa.
32. To use Alexa on a Fire TV device, you may use the voice remote or the Fire TV remote app, or you may pair your Fire TV device with a compatible Alexa-enabled device. You can use Alexa on Fire TV devices to search using your voice. Voice search is faster and less frustrating than typing on a traditional alphabet grid. To use voice search, press and hold the microphone button on your voice remote or Fire TV remote app, and say the movie, TV title, actor, genre, or director that you want. If you�re using the voice remote, release the microphone button when you're done speaking.
33. When you press the microphone button on the Alexa Voice Remote, a blue light bar appears on the Fire TV interface to indicate that the device is streaming audio to the Cloud.
34. You can turn on Alexa hands-free in your device settings (Settings > Alexa) by ensuring that both Alexa and Hands-Free Mode settings are enabled. To enter Show Mode, swipe down from the Quick Actions menu and toggle Show Mode, or ask Alexa to �Switch to Show Mode.�
35. Alexa on your Fire tablet uses on-device keyword spotting to detect the wake word, even when your device is in standby mode (Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 (7th Generation) tablets may not detect the wake word when the screen is off, if the tablet is not connected to power). When the wake word is detected, Alexa on your Fire tablet streams audio to the Cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word.
36. When Alexa on your Fire tablet detects the wake word, or when you press and hold the Home button to access Alexa, a blue line appears at the bottom of your screen to indicate that Alexa is streaming audio to the Cloud. When you use the wake word, the audio stream includes a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, and closes once your question or request has been processed. You will also hear a short audible tone that plays after the wake word is recognised, to indicate that the device is streaming audio, and at the end of your request, to indicate that the connection has closed and the device is no longer streaming audio.
37. When Alexa hands-free is activated and your tablet is passcode-locked, you can access certain Alexa features using the wake word. You'll be required to enter your passcode to access other Alexa features. If you prefer to no longer be asked to enter your passcode to access Alexa features, you can designate a wi-fi network as a Trusted Network in device settings (Settings > Alexa > Trusted Networks) and connect your Fire tablet to a Trusted Network. As a security precaution, if your tablet is passcode-locked, you may be prompted to enter your passcode to exit Show Mode�even if you're connected to a Trusted Network.
38. When in Show Mode, your tablet will turn on the screen when it detects the wake word or motion in view of the camera or when you interact with the devices' display or buttons.
39. There will be an on-screen indicator whenever Alexa is streaming images or video to the Cloud. For instance, if a video call is active, the device's screen will display a picture-in-picture view of the video being streamed to the Cloud.
40. You can turn off Alexa hands-free in a few different ways: by swiping down from the Quick Actions menu and selecting the Alexa microphone/camera on/off icon (in Show Mode) or the Alexa Hands-Free icon (outside Show Mode), by simultaneously pressing and holding the device�s volume up and down buttons for three seconds, or through your device settings (Settings > Alexa > Hands-Free Mode). When in Show Mode, a red bar and icon will appear to let you know that Alexa hands-free on your Fire tablet is turned off; outside of Show Mode, an icon will appear in your status bar. Your Fire tablet will not respond to the wake word � or, in Show Mode, detect motion in view of the camera - until you turn Alexa hands-free back on. If you turn off Alexa hands-free, you will still be able to access Alexa when your tablet is not in Show Mode by pressing and holding the Home button.
41. Echo devices are designed to detect only your chosen wake word (Alexa, Amazon, Computer or Echo). The device detects the wake word by identifying acoustic patterns that match the wake word. Once the word is detected, audio begins streaming to the cloud, including a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word. No audio is stored or sent to the Cloud unless the device detects the wake word (or Alexa is activated by pressing a button).
42. When Echo devices detect the wake word, or when the action button available on some Echo devices is pressed to activate Alexa, a visual indicator appears on the device to indicate that the device is streaming audio to the Cloud. For instance, a light ring on the Amazon Echo will turn blue or a blue bar will appear on Echo Show. When you use the wake word, the audio stream includes a fraction of a second of audio before the wake word, and closes once your question or request has been processed. You can turn on Follow-Up Mode to enable Alexa to respond to a series of requests without repeating the wake word. Learn more. You can also configure Echo devices to play a short audible tone any time audio is sent to the cloud within settings in the Alexa App.
43. Yes. Echo devices are equipped with a microphone off button. When the button is pressed, the power to the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated. When the microphones are turned off, your device cannot record and stream audio to the Cloud.
44. Echo devices with a screen will turn on the screen when they detect the wake word or motion in view of the camera or when you interact with the device's display or buttons.
45. There will be an on-screen indicator whenever Echo devices with a camera are streaming images or video to the Cloud. For instance, if a video call is active, the device�s screen will display a picture-in-picture view of the video being streamed to the Cloud or will display a green "call in progress" bar at the bottom of the screen.
46. Yes. You can turn off the camera on Echo devices with a camera by pushing the microphone/camera off button on your device. When the microphone/camera off button is pressed, the power to the camera and the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated. When the camera is turned off, the power to the camera and the microphones is disconnected and a dedicated red light is illuminated. When the camera is turned off, the device will not detect motion in view of the camera and you will not be able to use any features that rely on the camera such as video calling.
47. You need a home phone service (such as a landline or VoIP service), wi-fi, and a supported Echo device (Echo, Echo Dot, Echo Spot, Echo Plus, and Echo Show). One Echo Connect can support only one phone line, and only one Echo Connect can be registered per Amazon account.
48. Echo Connect extends and is not a replacement for your traditional telephone service. Plug Echo Connect into your home phone jack or VoIP adapter. You will also need to setup your supported Echo device. Then visit alexa.amazon.co.uk, or register for Alexa Calling and Messaging in the Alexa app in order to complete set up of your Echo Connect. With Echo Connect, you can ask Alexa to make calls using your home phone service to your contacts or to other numbers supported by your home phone service provider (e.g. "Alexa, call Mom" or "Alexa, call 03069990978). Echo Connect will display your home phone number as caller ID, unless you disable caller ID with your home phone service provider. You can also use your supported Echo devices to answer incoming calls to your home phone service (e.g. "Alexa, answer the phone"). As Echo Connect uses your existing home phone service to make and receive calls, home phone service provider charges may apply. Some calling features you may use on your home phone (such as call waiting and three-way calling) are not available through Echo Connect.
49. Echo Connect will use your home phone service to make and receive your calls. The mobile number used to register for Alexa Calling and Messaging will be displayed as a caller ID for calls made using Alexa Calling. You can disable the caller ID feature through your contact card in the Alexa App. Alexa Calling uses your Echo device's internet connection to place calls to another person who has registered for Alexa calling and messaging. For more information on Alexa Calling, see the above Alexa Calling and Messaging FAQs. If you select Echo Connect, your home phone service will be used to place all calls and your home phone number will be displayed as caller ID.
50. If you want to call another Alexa Calling and Messaging user, there are a few different ways your call may be processed. If you specify just the name of the person you would like to call (e.g. "Alexa, call Mum"), Alexa will default to placing the call through Alexa Calling to mom's supported Echo devices or the Alexa app. If you specify the name of the person and their phone type (e.g. "Alexa, call Mum's mobile") Alexa will place the call to mom's mobile using your home phone service through your Echo Connect. For more information, see the above FAQ "What's the difference between Alexa Calling and Echo Connect."
51. Yes, calling emergency services as 999 or 112 through Echo Connect works just like dialling any other phone number. Simply say, "Alexa, call 999�. Please note that if Echo Connect is used to call emergency numbers like 999, the location information given to the emergency service, if any, may be the address associated with the phone line connected to your Echo Connect, which may not be the same as the location of your Echo device from which you are making the call. Echo Connect will not function in the event of a power or broadband outage or other connectivity issues. If you are unable to place your call through your Echo Connect, you should use your mobile, landline telephone, or other telephone service.

15.	Bixby Home serves as a gateway to Bixby�s various functions and presents your most contextually relevant apps and services on a single screen, so the content you care about is just a swipe away. Bixby learns your routine and serves up the information you need when you need it. It looks for patterns in your app usage to predict what you might be looking for, and when you�re most likely to look for it.

19.	Yes, it does. Thanks to Bixby�s iterative deep learning technology, the more you use the interface, the smarter it gets.For example, whenever you�re not satisfied with its response, Bixby will work with you to learn how to better serve your needs. Each time Bixby responds to a command, it presents you with the option to �Teach me� � to select a more appropriate response from a list of similar commands. The next time you make that request, Bixby will remember exactly what you wanted it to do
20.	Bixby is optimized to detect voice commands when users are 15 to 20 centimeters (5.9 to 7.9 inches) away from their device. If you�re too close or too far, it can affect the voice recognition technology�s accuracy. For best results, speak clearly and at a volume comparable to normal conversation levels.
21.	Bixby works best in environments where your voice may be clearly heard. That being said, Bixby�s deep learning technology allows the interface to distinguish your voice commands from ambient noise, even when you�re listening to music, by carefully analyzing sound frequencies. When in particularly loud environments, you can activate Bixby Voice using your earphones� play/pause button and microphone.
22.	Bixby Voice is currently available in Korea and the U.S. and supports commands in Korean and U.S. English.

Quick Commands may be accessed under Bixby Home�s �My Bixby� menu.
24.	Bixby only utilizes your mobile data when listening to a command, not before or after. As a result, the length of the command ultimately determines the amount of mobile data used. If Bixby Voice is activated and you�re using a licensed SIM card, it�s possible to use the interface even when you�re overseas. Actual range of use may vary depending on the apps you�re using.
25.	Bixby Vision was designed to provide you with a deeper understanding of what you�re looking at, allowing you to use your camera to easily scan and search for relevant information on the objects and places around you. Bixby Vision offers information on everything from purchasing options for a particular product to details on your current location and even the bottle of wine you�re enjoying. It is also capable of scanning business cards and performing convenient translations. After scanning an object, users can use Bixby Vision�s image search function to locate it online. Once Bixby has identified the object, it will automatically pull up related images on Pinterest. Bixby Vision works best in bright environments, and when you hold your camera steady. The screen should not be upside down, and if the object in focus is a product, it should be captured from the front to aid identification.

Research your options and define your priorities. Contact the EducationUSA advising center nearest you and browse college search engines online. Check to see if the schools your are considering are accredited.
Colleges offer only undergraduate degrees while universities offer graduate degrees as well, but the terms are often used interchangeably.
In general, you must have completed high school and you must be at least 17 years of age.
The academic year usually runs from August through May with breaks for holidays. Most universities use either the semester system (two terms), the quarter system (students attend three out of four total terms), or the trimester system (three terms).
Undergraduate programs follow high school and lead to an associate (two-year) degree or a bachelor (four-year) degree. Graduate programs follow a bachelor�s degree and lead to a master�s or doctoral degree.
Associate: a two-year program that either leads to a specific vocation or transitions to a bachelor program. Bachelor: a four or five-year program where students earn credits in a wide variety of courses.
Masters: two-year degree providing additional specialization. Doctorate: five to eight-year program certifying the student as a trained research scholar and/or professor.
Yes, but they are highly selective and require a heavy courseload across a total of six years of study.
In a joint-degree program, students begin a graduate program in their fourth year of college, earning both degrees upon graduation.
MBA programs typically last one to two years.
With permission of the International Student Office, international students may work on campus up to 20 hours/week their first year and can apply to work off-campus in subsequent years.
Essentially there is no difference.
Distance education occurs when a student and an instructor are in different places. Learning occurs by mail, telephone, internet, or by other means.
Yes. To find accredited online distance learning programs, please search the Distance Education Accrediting Commission website.
Yes, although you may lose some credits and require extra time to complete your degree.
You must fulfill the requirements of a freshman applicant, as well as any supplemental information required by the transfer institution.
Community colleges are typically state-supported and provide the first two years of a four-year undergraduate degree.
Community colleges offer lower costs, easier admission policies, close ties to state schools,and many of the required courses connected to a degree.
The transfer process varies for each school. It is best to target the four-year institution early and determine what is needed to transfer.
Search the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Post-secondary Education website to see if an institution is accredited.
For specialized program accreditation, see �Accredited Institutions of Postsecondary Education,� available from American Council on Education.
Refer to college and university guides to find which institutions are known for excellence in different fields of study.
U.S. universities require an English language proficiency test before admission to ensure you can read, write, and speak fluently.
There are a number of programs for English language study in the United States and online, as well as local possibilities.
It depends: Some degree programs are highly structured. Bachelors' degrees are very flexible and sometimes allow you to create your own program.
You do not declare a major until the end of you second year of school.
A liberal arts college offers courses in humanities, languages, math, social and natural sciences, and students take 25-50% of their courses in their major.
A liberal arts college offers a smaller setting and teaches critical thinking and communication skills necessary in an ever-changing job market.
A credit is a value assigned to each course which reflects the number of hours the class will meet with the professor each week.
Grade Point Average (GPA) is a numeric indicator for a student's academic performance, calculated on a scale of 4.0.
Letter grades indicate a student's academic performance. Each letter grade has a numeric value which is used to calculate a GPA, on a scale of 4.0.
Grades are typically determined by quizzes, midterms, final exams, papers, projects, class attendance, and class participation.
State universities are funded by the state and are generally larger and less expensive than private universities.
Contact the office responsible for international programs at your institution to ask if your school has exchange agreements with U.S. universities.
Each U.S. university will want to review an international student's subjects and may ask the student to contact a credential evaluation agency.
U.S. institutions cannot issue I-20 forms for non-degree study, including vocational training. Community colleges offer technical/vocational study for an associate's degree.
Attend the closest EducationUSA advising center's predeparture orientation. Then, when you arrive on campus, attend all orientation meetings scheduled at your college or university.
Few if any institutions will do this. Applications usually require a fee and take time to be processed, so pre-approval is generally not feasible.
Letters of recommendation can come from past professors, coaches, college advisors or professionals such as a manager or HR manager, etc.
probably not. For the most part, institutions expect you to reapply if you get accepted into a program but do not register.
It depends. Some institutions require it, some do not. If it is required, it might be conducted as a group interview for the potential cohort, instead of individually by candidate.
Yes. Federal financial aid requires that students take at least half of the normal course load to qualify. The actual number of courses/ credits depends on the institution and program.
The first step is determine your eligibility for the grad program to which you have applied. If you are accepted, your resume and cover letter help determine if you are shortlisted for assistantship, and usually an interview is one of the final stages before a decision is made.
Typically you wait until you are accepted into a degree program (usually need to be a full-time applicant) and then you can apply for federal (e.g. FAFSA), school and third-party organization scholarships, grants (e.g., TEACH grant), fellowships, loans, etc.
Courses might be offered in the evenings, weekends or specific seasons. This facilitates flexibility of schedules for students who cannot take the regular class offering.
Most institutions allow grad students to enroll part-time in at least some semesters. For an education degree, however, there may be some requirement for mandatory full-time sessions such as in a Summer semester.
Most programs start in the Fall, though the option to start in other semesters is possible. Talk to your grad advisor. If there is no course sequence to adhere to, the option is more likely.
Self-paced online courses offer schedule flexibility but may require more discipline to complete. However, they are typically designed to be the equivalent of their on-campus counterpart courses and so, in theory, should not take more effort.
While it helps, this is normally not necessary at the undergrad level. You can specialize at the master�s level and gain the necessary knowledge then.
It depends on the state. Some states require no license at all. However, there may be certain requirements, including academic achievements, career plans, etc. average of around 4 months.

Artificial Intelligence is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machine that work and reacts like humans.
Artificial intelligence Neural Networks can model mathematically the way biological brain works, allowing the machine to think and learn the same way the humans do- making them capable of recognizing things like speech, objects and animals like we do.
Artificial Intelligence can be used in many areas like Computing, Speech recognition, Bio-informatics, Humanoid robot, Computer software, Space and Aeronautics�s etc.
Perl language is not commonly used programming language for AI
In AI, Prolog is a programming language based on logic.
Strong AI makes strong claims that computers can be made to think on a level equal to humans while weak AI simply predicts that some features that are resembling to human intelligence can be incorporated to computer to make it more useful tools.
Statistical AI is more concerned with �inductive� thought like given a set of pattern, induce the trend etc. While, classical AI, on the other hand, is more concerned with � deductive� thought given as a set of constraints, deduce a conclusion etc.
Alternate Key: Excluding primary keys all candidate keys are known as Alternate Keys. Artificial Key: If no obvious key either stands alone or compound is available, then the last resort is to, simply create a key, by assigning a number to each record or occurrence. This is known as artificial key. Compound Key: When there is no single data element that uniquely defines the occurrence within a construct, then integrating multiple elements to create a unique identifier for the construct is known as Compound Key. Natural Key: Natural key is one of the data element that is stored within a construct, and which is utilized as the primary key.
The production rule comprises of a set of rule and a sequence of steps.
The �depth first search� method takes less memory.
Heuristic approach is the best way to go for game playing problem, as it will use the technique based on intelligent guesswork. For example, Chess between humans and computers as it will use brute force computation, looking at hundreds of thousands of positions.
A* algorithm is based on best first search method, as it gives an idea of optimization and quick choose of path, and all characteristics lie in A* algorithm.
A hybrid Bayesian network contains both a discrete and continuous variables.
Anything perceives its environment by sensors and acts upon an environment by effectors are known as Agent. Agent includes Robots, Programs, and Humans etc.
In partial order planning , rather than searching over possible situation it involves searching over the space of possible plans. The idea is to construct a plan piece by piece.
a) Add an operator (action) b) Add an ordering constraint between operators
�Attachment� is considered as not a desirable property of a logical rule based system.
In artificial intelligence, neural network is an emulation of a biological neural system, which receives the data, process the data and gives the output based on the algorithm and empirical data.
An algorithm is said completed when it terminates with a solution when one exists.
A heuristic function ranks alternatives, in search algorithms, at each branching step based on the available information to decide which branch to follow.
In a planning system, the function of the third component is to detect when a solution to problem has been found.
Generality is the measure of ease with which the method can be adapted to different domains of application.
A top-down parser begins by hypothesizing a sentence and successively predicting lower level constituents until individual pre-terminal symbols are written.
These are the two strategies which are quite similar. In best first search, we expand the nodes in accordance with the evaluation function. While, in breadth first search a node is expanded in accordance to the cost function of the parent node.
Frames are a variant of semantic networks which is one of the popular ways of presenting nonprocedural knowledge in an expert system. A frame which is an artificial data structure is used to divide knowledge into substructure by representing �stereotyped situations�. Scripts are similar to frames, except the values that fill the slots must be ordered. Scripts are used in natural language understanding systems to organize a knowledge base in terms of the situation that the system should understand.
FOPL stands for First Order Predicate Logic, Predicate Logic provides a) A language to express assertions about certain �World� b) An inference system to deductive apparatus whereby we may draw conclusions from such assertion c) A semantic based on set theory
a) A set of constant symbols b) A set of variables c) A set of predicate symbols d) A set of function symbols e) The logical connective f) The Universal Quantifier and Existential Qualifier g) A special binary relation of equality
In online search, it will first take action and then observes the environment.
RBFE and SMA* will solve any kind of problem that A* can�t by using a limited amount of memory.
In Artificial Intelligence to answer the probabilistic queries conditioned on one piece of evidence, Bayes rule can be used.
For building a Bayes model in AI, three terms are required; they are one conditional probability and two unconditional probability.
While creating Bayesian Network, the consequence between a node and its predecessors is that a node can be conditionally independent of its predecessors.
If a Bayesian Network is a representative of the joint distribution, then by summing all the relevant joint entries, it can solve any query.
Inductive logic programming combines inductive methods with the power of first order representations.
The objective of an Inductive Logic Programming is to come up with a set of sentences for the hypothesis such that the entailment constraint is satisfied.
There are three literals available in top-down inductive learning methods they are a) Predicates b) Equality and Inequality c) Arithmetic Literals
�Inverse Resolution� inverts a complete resolution, as it is a complete algorithm for learning first order theories.
In speech recognition, Acoustic signal is used to identify a sequence of words.
Biagram model gives the probability of each word following each other word in speech recognition.
To solve temporal probabilistic reasoning, HMM (Hidden Markov Model) is used, independent of transition and sensor model.
Hidden Markov Models are a ubiquitous tool for modelling time series data or to model sequence behaviour. They are used in almost all current speech recognition systems.
The state of the process in HMM�s model is described by a �Single Discrete Random Variable�.
�Possible States of the World� is the possible values of the variable in HMM�s.
While staying within the HMM network, the additional state variables can be added to a temporal model.
In Artificial Intelligence, to extract the meaning from the group of sentences semantic analysis is used.
The process of determining the meaning of P*Q from P,Q and* is known as Compositional Semantics.
In Propositional Logic, Logical Inference algorithm can be solved by using a) Logical Equivalence b) Validity c) Satisfying ability
�Unification� process makes different logical expressions identical. Lifted inferences require finding substitute which can make a different expression looks identical. This process is called unification.
In �Unification and Lifting� the algorithm that takes two sentences and returns a unifier is �Unify� algorithm.
State space search is the most straight forward approach for planning algorithm because it takes account of everything for finding a solution.
First check the computer's power cord to make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket.  
When your computer no longer responds to keyboard commands your best bet is to restart the computer. 
As with most computer errors, your first step is to shut down your computer and restart it. 
Make sure the monitor is on. If no power light (green or orange light) is seen on the monitor display try pressing the power button until it comes on.  
Disconnect the video cable going from the back of the computer and verify that no pins are bent, burnt or broken. Verify no speakers, fans or other magnetic devices are close to the monitor. 
Verify that the monitor is properly connected in the back of the monitor as well as to the back of the computer.  
If this occurs, the resolution can be changed back to the original setting or you can manually adjust the monitor. 
Users who have an optical mechanical mouse (most common mouse for desktop computers) are likely experiencing erratic behaviour because the mouse is not clean or is dirty.  
If you're running any version of Microsoft Windows and are encountering issues with the mouse wheel, first attempt to adjust the mouse settings through the Mouse Properties window. This window can be accessed by opening the Control Panel and double-clicking the Mouse icon. 
The keys on a keyboard are only clipped on, with a knife or other thin object, carefully pop the keys off, this will allow you to clean under the keys as well as cleaning the keys themselves. 
To get into the Windows 7 / 10 Safe mode, as the computer is starting up press and hold your "F8 Key" which should bring up the "Windows Advanced Options Menu". Use your arrow keys to move to "Safe Mode" and press your Enter key. 
Close all programs running on the computer and try again.  
If you are running Microsoft Windows 7, Windows 10, or a later version of Microsoft Windows, you are eligible to update Microsoft Windows, and in some cases, your computer hardware with the latest drivers through Microsoft's update site, visit http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com 
Users should not simply press the power button or restart the computer while Windows is still running unless there is an issue with the computer.  
Double click the recycle bin icon on your desktop, here you will see all of the files within your bin. Select the files you wish to recover, right click and choose restore. 
Verify that your computer is able to see the Internet and/or other computers to ensure that your computer is not encountering a connection issue, which would be causing your e-mail issue. Ensure that your Internet e-mail server or your Network e-mail server is not encountering issues by contacting either your Internet Service Provider or your Network administrator. 
If the e-mail box is full of other e-mail messages, and/or your storage space is only a few megabytes, it's possible that the attachment being sent cannot be received.

The terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a CPU), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.  
To install a 64-bit version of Windows, you need a CPU that's capable of running a 64-bit version of Windows. The benefits of using a 64-bit operating system are most apparent when you have a large amount of random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer, typically 4 GB of RAM or more. In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system, a 64-bit system can be more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently.  
To find out if your computer is running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows in Windows 7 or Windows Vista: Open System by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties. Under System, you can view the system type. 
With an object server, the Client/Server application is written as a set of communicating objects. 
It is a system that performs a protocol translation between different electronic mail delivery protocols. 
It is a simple protocol used to exchange information between the routers. 
It is a set of rules defining a very simple virtual terminal interaction. The NVT is used in the start of a Telnet session. 
It is a sequence of IP addresses identifying the route a datagram must follow. A source route may optionally be included in an IP datagram header. 
It is a protocol used to advertise the set of networks that can be reached with in an autonomous system. BGP enables this information to be shared with the autonomous system. This is newer than EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol). 
It is a protocol formerly used to exchange routing information between Internet core routers. 
With a transaction server, the client invokes remote procedures that reside on the server with an SQL database engine.  
With a database server, the client passes SQL requests as messages to the database server. The results of each SQL command are returned over the network.  
User interface, Business Logic and Shared data. 
Ubiquitous communications, Network OS extension, Binary large objects (BLOBs).Global directories and Network yellow pages. 
Triggers are special user defined actions usually in the form of stored procedures, that are automatically invoked by the server based on data related events. . 
Transparency really means hiding the network and its servers from the users and even the application programmers. 
TP-Lite is simply the integration of TP Monitor functions in the database engines. TP-Heavy are TP Monitors which supports the Client/Server architecture and allow PC to initiate some very complex multiserver transaction from the desktop. 
TP lite, based on stored procedures. TP heavy, based on the TP monitors. 
This new model of Client/Server consists of thin, protable, "universal" clients that talk to superfat servers. In the simplest form, a web server returns documents when clients ask for them by name. The clients and server communicate using an RPC-like protocol called HTTP. 
These are fully-loaded machines which includes multiprocessors, high-speed disk arrays for interview I/O and fault tolerant features. 
There is no commonly accepted definition for a TP monitor. According to Jeri Edwards' a TP Monitor is "an OS for transaction processing". 
They were originally introduced to run classes of applications that could service hundreds and sometimes thousands of clients. TP Monitors provide an OS - on top of existing OS - that connects in real time these thousands of humans with a pool of shared server processes. 
There is a many-to-one relationship between clients and server. Clients always initiate the dialog by requesting a service. Servers are passively awaiting for requests from clients. 
The triggers are called implicitly by database generated events, while stored procedures are called explicitly by client applications. 
The grouped SQL statements are called Transactions (or) A transaction is a collection of actions embused with ACID properties.

Middleware is a distributed software needed to support interaction between clients and servers. In short, it is the software that is in the middle of the Client/Server systems and it acts as a bridge between the clients and servers.  
It waits for client-initiated requests. Executes many requests at the same time. Takes care of VIP clients first. Initiates and runs background task activity. Keeps running. Grown bigger and faster. 
It treats all processors as equal. Any processor can do the work of any other processor. Applications are divided into threads that can run concurrently on any available processor. 
It includes the communication stacks, distributed directories, authentication services, network time, RPC, Queuing services along with the network OS extensions such as the distributed file and print services. 
Database specific middleware,OLTP specific middleware,Groupware specific middleware. 
It imposses hierarchy and a division of labour among processors. Only one designated processor, the master, controls (in a tightly coupled arrangement) slave processors dedicated to specific functions. 
In the transaction server, the client component usually includes GUI and the server components usually consists of SQL transactions against a database.

The best source is the google help center. This provides online articles and troubleshooters that cover most everything you might need to know about Gmail. Next would be to enter your question in the Google Help Forum search bar. Where you can get answers to FAQs or answers from other google users.
If you are unable to log into your account, you will need to go to https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery.There you will have one or more of the following options; Using a pre-configured recovery phone, Using a pre-configured recovery email or Prove ownership by answering questions about the Google account. "If Google couldn't verify you" it means you have not been able to prove account ownership and repeating the process will not help unless you can provide more accurate information. There are no other options for account recovery, and Google will not return an account unless you can prove ownership of it. If all three of the above fail then the account is probably lost.

Gmail ignores both dots "." and caps in both account creation and e-mail delivery.  That means first.last@, firstlast@, and First.Last@ all represent the same account.  If you receive e-mail intended for someone else then either the sender accidentally used the wrong e-mail address, or they were given the wrong e-mail address.
If you receive e-mail intended for someone else using an address with different characters or numbers in the address, it could be because your address is in the BCC field (very common for spam) or because the receiver made an error in auto-forwarding sending them to the wrong account.
In order to fully secure your account you must check both your Gmail account settings (Gmail Security Checklist) and your Google account settings (Account Security Checkup).
To change your Gmail password, use a browser to log into the Gmail web interface at https://mail.google.com/ then go to:  Settings -> Accounts -> Change Account Settings -> Change Password.
Pick a strong password including letters, numbers and other allowed symbols, and keep it just for Gmail - don't use it on other sites. 
To switch the account you are viewing, start by signing out of whatever account you are in, then go to https://mail.google.com/ and sign into the account you want to access. To sign in into another account you own in addition to the current one, click on your picture/avatar in the upper/right and select "Add account" from the drop-down panel.
The answer to this is dependent on when (less or more than 30 days) and why (by you or due to a compromised account) the messages were deleted.
If you are notified that your account has been disabled and you feel it is a mistake, a link will be provided under "Next steps for disabled accounts" where you may submit an appeal.
For all non-Google email accounts you must ask your other provider for the SMTP Server name, port number and security setting they require you to use, and enter that information in the set-up boxes. If your "other account" is only a forwarding address and has no entitlement to use an SMTP server, then you cannot set it up as a Send Mail As address in Gmail
To sync to your Google account when Sync Contacts is turned on, all contacts created on your phone must be tagged with the Google contact type. Some phones provide this as the default - others, notably Samsung, require you to select the Google contact type every time. If you do not do that, then the contact will only be saved on your phone, will not sync to your Google account, and will be lost if you reset your phone or change phones. 
Gmail recently enforced a higher security sign in procedure no longer using OAuth as the default access method. While developers have received warning from Google, not all e-mail clients and apps have been updated to use the new protocol. To allow your email client apps to continue to sign in to Gmail the old way, you need to turn on access for these "Less secure Apps" in your Gmail security settings.
Yes. You can do things like search on Google and watch YouTube videos that aren't age-restricted without signing in to a Google Account.
Yes. A Google profile is only necessary if you want to share publicly or engage with content on Google+. A profile helps you communicate with the people you know from a variety of Google products " for example, sharing driving directions from Google Maps or sharing a video from YouTube. Your Google profile lets you control the details you share about yourself, not only on Google+ but through services like Gmail and Web Search.
Yes, but you can choose how much or how little to share. The name is the only part of a profile that must be public. If you choose to share other information, such as interests, hometown or email address, you can decide who gets to see it. On your Profile and privacy settings page, you can change the information on your profile, as well as who can see what details. Learn more about sharing informationon Google+.
Your Gmail address and other contact information will not be public on your profile by default. If you want to share this information with others, you can share it with certain contacts or make it public by managing your profile settings.
Personalization on non-Google websites allows Google to tailor ads to you across the Web, based on your Google profile.
To help make sign-in easier and more personal, you may see a screen with your profile picture and full name when signing in to Google. We'll only show this information if you are signing in from a location or device you've signed in from before, like your home computer. Also, if you have multiple Google accounts (for example, personal and work), you can set up different profile pictures for each of your accounts to easily tell them apart. You can always change your profile photo if you want a different image to show, or you can remove your photo from profile settings if you don't want your profile picture to appear at all.
When you sign in to Google, you'll first enter your email address or phone number, and select Next. Then, you'll enter your password and select Next. If you're a 2-Step Verification user or signing in from a new device, you might be asked to complete additional steps to verify your identity. To help make sign-in more personal, you may see a screen with your profile picture and full name when signing in to Google. We'll only show this information if you are signing in from a location or device you've signed in from before, like your home computer.
Your Google Account username is your username across all of Google, including Gmail. You can sign in to any Google service with your Google Account username and password.
We'll use your new Gmail address to send you notifications from Google services. However, we may use your other email address to help you get back into your account if you lose your password, or for certain notifications such as if we suspect that your account has been compromised.
We like Gmail a lot, and if you try it out, we hope you will too! However, if you decide not to use Gmail, and instead want a different email address associated with your Google Account, you can cancel your Gmail address.
If you'd like to sign in with your current email address, you can always add an alternate email address to your account. That way, you can sign in to your Google Account with either your alternate email address or your primary Gmail address.
After you sign in to your Google Account, you'll stay signed in unless you specifically sign out. To sign in temporarily on a computer, phone, or tablet, you can browse privately.
Search History helps deliver more personalized search results based on your web activity, including your previous searches. When you sign up for a Google Account, Search History is automatically enabled. You can turn search history on or off at any time. To view, control, and delete your saved activity, visit My Activity.
Google search results are a reflection of the content publicly available on the web. Search engines can't remove content directly from websites, so removing search results from Google wouldn't remove the content from the web. If you want to remove something from the web, you should contact the webmaster of the site the content is posted on and ask him or her to make a change. Once the content has been removed and Google has noted the update, the information will no longer appear in Google's search results.
In some cases, yes. When you click on a search result in Google Search, your web browser also may send the Internet address, or URL, of the search results page to the destination webpage as the Referrer URL. The URL of the search results page may sometimes contain the search query you entered. If you are using SSL Search (Google's encrypted search functionality), under most circumstances, your search terms will not be sent as part of the URL in the Referrer URL. There are some exceptions to this behaviour, such as if you are using some less popular browsers. More information on SSL Search can be found here. Search queries or information contained in the Referrer URL may be available via Google Analytics or an application programming interface (API). In addition, advertisers may receive information relating to the exact keywords that triggered an ad click.

The Internet of Everything is the intelligent connection of people, process, data and things.
The Internet of Everything brings together people, process, data and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than  ever before - turning information into actions that create new  capabilities, richer experiences and unprecedented economic opportunity  for businesses, individuals and countries.
The “Internet of Everything” builds on the foundation of the "Internet of Things" by adding network intelligence that allows convergence, orchestration and visibility across previously disparate systems.
The explosion of new connections joining the Internet of Everything is driven by the development of IP-enabled devices, the increase in global broadband availability and the advent of IPv6.
Some important considerations in the Internet of Everything include privacy, security, energy consumption and network congestion.
The network plays a critical role in the Internet of Everything – it must provide an intelligent, manageable, secure infrastructure that can scale to support billions of context-aware devices.
The Internet of Everything represents the business opportunity that the new brand campaign addresses. It is not the company vision or tagline.
There is plenty of room for improvement.Smart watches: A recent HP study revealed security and privacy issues in all of the top 10 smart watch brands. Issues include lack of transport encryption, automatic connectivity to any Bluetooth device within range, and problems with lock down screens. Smart home systems: These systems show many problems, including not encrypting data and having weak password policies. Smart TVs: Some brands leave data vulnerable in transit. For example, in 2015, researchers discovered some Samsung smart TVs were sending unencrypted voice recognition data and text information.  All of these connected devices share data with mobile phones and tablets and are often programmed to automatically connect to any Bluetooth or Wi-Fi network. And, anytime a device is connected to a "public" network, there are risks involved (e.g., data theft and sabotage). This automatic connection feature makes these devices vulnerable when connecting to any "public" network.
Lack of understanding and devotion to good security protocols.Many IoT devices lack the computing power of a desktop or laptop computer, or other higher-end devices, which makes it difficult to implement strong security. A cultural divide exists between InfoSec professionals (those concerned with keeping the communications between devices secure), and mechanical and electrical engineers (those concerned with the switches, motors, etc., making sure the devices operate). InfoSec as an industry needs to do a better job of reaching out to build relationships with the engineers, and better demonstrate the value of security more effectively to bridge that cultural divide.
The security industry can do this in several ways, but it starts with recognizing the problems and then providing better education about the solutions. In most cases, the technology is available and just needs to be implemented. For example, SSL/TLS provides strong and scalable encryption at the scale that the IoT demands. Sophisticated, managed PKI systems can handle strong identity vetting and provide reliable data encryption across all objects and devices within IoT deployments. A PKI solution should be the standard for IoT. The security industry needs to help vendors understand the risks associate with poor IoT security. First, we need to present information from the point-of-view of an end-user. Second, organizations need to be made aware of the financial impact of poor security: lowered sales, diminished trust in their brand, or even health and safety risks when healthcare devices, critical infrastructure, and national defense are included in the conversation. Simple protections can be put in place that notify end-users to set up controls over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, enabling lock screens, and other basic security functions.
An organization needs to choose a Certificate Authority partner that is trusted and can scale effectively to meet their IoT requirements.
During manufacturing the private key is placed directly on the device by its own cryptographic library, or by a hub/controller as close to the device as possible.
Scripting OpenSSL to create certificate signing requests (CSRs) based on a few pieces of input could be done with less than 10 lines of code.
It can range from 50 to 1,000 lines of code across the various devices that need encrypted communications.
Typically, it is stored on the device using Operating System (OS) access controls; otherwise, it's stored in a FIPS-compliant HSM.
Yes, the private key can be stored in hardware.
No, the private key should be stored on-device.
SCEP, EST, RESTful API (JSON or XML).
The device is seeded during manufacturing or during the device enrollment process.
Ideally, the IoT provider uses a crypto engine on device to create the private key, making sure to use a strong random number generator to create the private key.
The IoT provider use the same process as was initially used to seed the device.
Revocations are managed through an online interface/API call. The revocation must be submitted for a specific serial number or certificate ID.
The device management console should set access rules and controls for systems, devices, certificates, and their connections.
The customer uses authenticated and/or signed messaging to and from devices based on the current trust status of certificates in use on those systems.
Certificate expiration lengths are based on the project needs.
Yes, certificates can be automatically provisioned and enrolled.
Signing verification is straightforward, so probably less than 200 lines of code (given necessary libraries are present).
This would depend on the communication method and available libraries, but for something like MQTT, probably less than 200 lines of code.
Interoperability between various wireless and networking standards is still an issue and something that forums and standards bodies are trying to address.
It already is having an impact. A recent report from Gartner says there will be 4.9bn connected things in 2015, rising to 25bn by 2020.
IoT is not about a single algorithm. There are literally thousands of algorithms that are in common use. It all depends on what you want to do. A relatively simple IoT application may end up using dozens of algorithms. A good book to get a feeling is the classic by Knuth titled: The Art of Computer Programming.
Theoretically, IPV6 has enough address space to allow IoT devices to be covered by a common construct, providing a path to consistency and inter-operability. That does not mean that each IoT node is on the internet, and some deployments are architected to aggregate IoT nodes using non-IP protocols at an internet gateway. There is a very wide range of opinions on how to do this and is part of the learning curve.
There are solutions in the IoT landscape that are not very data intensive: it could be as little as one bit (is something on or off). On the other hand, it could be astronomical: think of a high-resolution camera that is producing a streaming video where you record all the bits, and then think of many such cameras producing data at the same time. Think of a major satellite system such as NASA's EOS (Earth Observing System) that has high-resolution instruments streaming high-resolution data.
There is no monolithic IoT. A single instance may consume a small fraction of a watt. A single cloud rack in an IoT Data Center might consume 30-60KW. Meanwhile, a large robot or autonomous machine like an agricultural combine may consume more than 100KW. The aggregate in power consumption from 50 billion IoT devices might be considerable! A good exercise is to go through and compare IoT power usage to other sources of consumption.
Security is recognized as a challenge. Regulatory bodies are mandating that security or privacy must be built in from the scratch - but that's hardly realistic. My own view is that we are on a learning curve and security is one of the items we have to conquer - that does not mean it will impede deployment, but it will impact design and applications especially for critical functions.
It will have quite an impact because it will dictate where the infrastructure is located, as well as who has access to it. The ability to do things from anywhere at any time will be restricted. It is an example where non-technical issues have real consequences.
I suspect that IoT will change the nature of financial services profoundly. You can think of an ATM machine as an early precursor. Over time, many aspects of financial services, from payment systems to the use of blockchain ledgers, will be mainstream.
You might control some functions in a home. It might be heating and cooling, maintenance for appliances, security, looking after the garden, etc.
If you have a good background and are adept at systems thinking, you will get your pick of what's available. IoT is not a bad area to grow your career.
Standardization is very important for adoption, for scale, and consequently for cost structure. Some of the standards bodies don't pay enough attention to the needs of developing nations, so it is crucial to have venues where technology can be localized to take into account practice, customs, markets, and economics at the right level.
BlockChain are centralized as well as decentralized as opposed to the popular belief that BlockChains are decentralized. Private or centralized BlockChain mechanism has restricted entry to make changes to the ledger whereas in public or decentralized BlockChain anybody can have access to the ledger(Bitcoin, Ripple etc.)
Merkle Tree is used to verify the transaction in the quickest time and less space complexity.
When a transaction occurs in a BlockChain the first step is to hash each transaction in the memory pool using SHA256.These hashes are then placed into a Merkle Tree (hash tree).The hashes of transactions are grouped into two and then concatenated result is hashed again until the tree is formed.
Hash at the top of the tree is called the Merkle root.The Merkle Root of this hash tree is placed into the block's header along with the hash of the previous block and a random number called a nonce.The block's header is then hashed with SHA256 producing an output that will serve as the block's identifier.
ECDSA is a cryptographic algorithm used by Bitcoin to ensure that the legitimacy of the transaction.It works on the principle of ECCDLP (elliptic curve cryptography discrete logarithmic problem) which means it is easy to go from A'>B but almost impossible to go from B'>A i.e ECC is a trapdoor function.
ECC and RSA both algorithms work on the principle of asymmetric encryption.In asymmetric encryption, there is a public key for encryption and private key for decryption. ECC is better than RSA because it provides equivalent security for a much lesser key size which makes ECC faster and more secure.As for equal key size, ECC would be more secure than RSA.
A ledger is typically a database.The blockchain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the blockchain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender.
Ledgers can be centralized or decentralized depending on public or private BlockChain.
A distributed ledger is a database that is spread across several nodes or computing devices which are in layman terms the miners who run the algorithm on their computing devices. Every node copy and saves an identical copy of the ledger. Each participating node of the network updates itself independently.
The most striking feature of distributed ledger technology is that the ledger is not maintained by any central authority. Updates to the ledger are independent and done by each node. The nodes then vote on the update(transaction) to ensure that the majority agrees with the conclusion. This voting and agreement on one copy of the ledger is called consensus and is executed by a consensus algorithm.
BlockChains are only a form of distributed ledger technology. Every distributed ledger doesn't use a chain of blocks to provide a secure and valid distributed confidenceA BlockChain is distributed and is managed by peer-to-peer networks. Since it is a distributed ledger, it can exist without a centralized authority or server managing it, and its data quality can be maintained by database replication and computational trust. 
The structure of the BlockChain makes it distinct from other kinds of distributed ledgers. Data on a BlockChain is grouped together and organized in blocks. The blocks are then linked to one another and secured using  ECC cryptography. 
A quorum is the number of nodes required to reach agreement within a system. FBAs instead use "quorum slices". A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum, which can convince another specific node to agree.
Segment Tree is a basically a binary tree used for storing the intervals or segments. The underlying principle behind this data structure is to store certain values of ranges as a balanced binary tree and hence query and update can be performed efficiently. 
Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm used to exchange a secret key between two parties. It is used in symmetric encryption algorithms like AES
Boxes are linked backward to the previous block in BlockChain.Genesis block is the first block of the BlockChain.A block can never have more than one parent block.

Business rules implied by the contract embedded in Block Chain.
Cannot be modified, are added to the ledger with appropriate confidentiality and are endorsed by a subset of business network participants.
A more efficient transaction processing system across a business network.
An identifiable business network or business problem to be solved or the need for trust.
A limited scope and/or a smaller business network and/or scalable project that can grow participants and scenarios.
In its simplest form, burning a token means making the token permanently unspendable. There are a few ways of doing this, such as sending the tokens to a bogus address (an address with no known private key) so that the token is no longer usable.
A contract address can never be accessed directly (no private key). If I write a contract, I can add a function that if the contract receives ethers that came not through a function (for example a deposit()-function) but were directly paid, that those ethers get returned to the payer. But if I do not add such a repay-/revert- function, the ethers would be lost in the wallet forever. They then can not even be accessed by the contract owner.
Never do the inconsistent naming Use the latest version of the solidity compiler. Consider using Solidity's require the function to express preconditions concisely. Try to keep the gas cost low as possible. Do the unit testing of the smart contracts using the Mocha Framework.  Try to use the "self-destruct " function at the end of the smart contract.
ERC20 token is a set of standards that are defined in the Ethereum, they consist of 5 functions and 2 events that help the transfer of tokens and listening to events.Most of the ICOS are using the ERC20 token as a standard token.There have been several improvements in the ethereum network also known as EIPs which have increased the functions of tokens.
MyEtherWallet runs an Ethereum node, and enables RPC on that node. This allows the client-side web3 library to connect to their node, and request information such as balance, or submitting signed transactions.Further wise they make use of a library called ethereumjs-wallet, which allows you to convert a private key to an address (which is then used to request balances), and a library called ethereumjs-tx which can sign raw transactions with private keys.
Using IPFS is almost definitely the right approach, as writing data to the BlockChain is usually prohibitively expensive. Having stored the data in IPFS and got the hash back, you can read the data using ipfs.cat(document_hash).If you want to put a document in storage, you can convert it to bytes then store the bytes on the BlockChain, but you don't want to do this. Putting documents in the event logs may be somewhat less impossible but don't.
If you want to send ethers to smart contract you should define a payable function it could be the fallback function.otherwise, you will get an error.
Ropsten test network, Kovan test network, Rinkeby test network.
Generally we use the REMIX IDE which is present online, or we can use the Truffle for the development and testing of smart contracts.
BlockChain is a distributed ledger, which has a shared database based on consensus algorithm.
POW ( proof of work ) which bitcoin uses, POS ( proof of stake), DPOS ( Delegated proof at stake).
Hash functions take any string of fixed size ( 256 bits in this case ) and generate a fixed size alphanumeric string
